## About Myself
I've spent 5 eventful years in a travel industry. At first, I was working in a travel agency being responsible for 5 visa departments and after that I've spent a few years working as a travel specialist in IT company developing my skills in business trips organisation process. It was unforgettable experience! 

Currently I have worked for more then a year as internal mobility specialist helping employees to get the offer and relocate to another prefferable destination from a wide list of our offices all around the world.

Having worked in IT company for almost 6 years I has been interested in production process. Right now I'm keen on Front-End development a lot! And hope one day I will become a strong Fron-End developer joining a large community of developers and providing myselt at the same time with endless possibilities for professional growth.
